\paragraph{Brute Force}
Brute force will take \(O(n^2)\) time. Any method of looking at entries
one by one will have have at worst, a quadratic time complexity
since there can be \(\frac{n^2}{2}\) inversions.

\paragraph{Divide and Conquer Method}
We can split the array into two equal parts \(A_{\hi}\) and \(A_{\lo}.\)

Then, for all of the elements in \(A_{\hi}\) and the total inversions is
the number of elements in \(A_{\lo}\) that are less than the elements of
\(A_{\hi}\).

We may sort both \(A_{\hi}\) and \(A_{\lo}\).
Then, we seek to merge the arrays together. Every time we pull an element
from \(A\), we add the number of elements remaining in \(A_{\lo}\)
to the total number of inversions as, all of those elements are greater than
our current element from \(A_{\hi}\) but to the left of our current element.
