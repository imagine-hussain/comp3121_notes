\section{Network Flow Algorithms}

\subsection{Flow networks}

\paragraph{Definition: Flow Network}
A flow network \( G = (V, E) \) is a directed graph where each edge
\( e = (u, v) \in  E \) has a positive integer capacity
\( c(u, v) > 0 \).

There are two special vertices. A source \( s \) and sink  \( t \).
There are no outgoing edges for a sink and likewise, no incoming edges
for a source.

\paragraph{Flow}
A flow in \( G \) is a function  \( f: E \to  [0, \infty) \) such that
\(  f(u, v) > 0 \). The function \( f \) must satisfy
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Capacity Contraints:} \( f(u, v) \leq c(u, v)\), forall
     \( e(u, v) \in  E \).
  \item \textbf{Flow Conservation:} For all \( v \in V \backslash \{(s, t)\} \),
    we require \[
        \sum_{(u, v) \in  E} f(u, v) = \sum_{(v, w) \in  E}
    .\]
    That is, the incoming flow must be equal to the outgoing flow.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Value of Flow}
The value of flow is defined by \[
  |f| = \sum_{v: (s, v) \in E} f(s, v)
  =
  \sum_{v: (v, t) \in  E} f(v, t)
.\]
That is, the flow leaving the source or, flow arriving at sink.

\paragraph{Goal of Flow Network}
Given a flow network, the aim is to find a flow of maximal value.

\paragraph{Integrality Theorem}
If all capacities are integers, then there exists a flow of maximum value
such that \( f(u, v) \) is an integer for all
edges  \( \left( u, v \right) \in  E \).

\paragraph{Greedy Does not Work}
The obvious greedy solution would be to send flow arbitrarity,
one-unit at a time. However, this may converge to some local maximum
that is not reflective of the true global maximum.

\paragraph{Residual Flow Network}
Given a flow network, the \textit{residual flow network} is the network
is the network made up of the leftover capacities.

\paragraph{New Edges}
Suppoe there is en edge \( e(v, w) \) with capacity  \( c_1 \)
and flow  \( f_1 \) units and edge \( e(w, v) \)
with  \( c_2, f_2 \) capacity and flow respectively.

The forward edge \( v \to  w \) allows \( c_1 - f_1 \)
additional units of flow. We can also send \( f_2 \)
units to cancel the flow to the reverse edge.

Thus, we create edges \( v \to  w \) with a capacity of
\( c_1 - f_1 + f_2 \) for the forward edge and,
\( c_2 - f_2 + f_1 \) on the backwards edge.

\paragraph{Augmenting Path}
An \textit{augmenting path} is a path from \( s \to  t \) in the residual flow network.

The capacity of an augmenting path is the capacity of its \textit{bottleneck}
edge. That is, the edge of smallest capacity.

We should then send that amount of flow along the augmenting path, recalculating
the flow and the residual capacities for each edge used.

\paragraph{Recalculating Augmented Path}
Suppose we have an augmenting path of capaity \( f \)
that includes an edge  \( v \to  w \). Then,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cancel up to \( f \) units of flow being sent from  \( w \to  v \)
  \item Add the remainder of theose \( f \) units to the flow being sent
    from  \( v \to  w \). That is, reverse the flow.
  \item Increase the residual capacity from \( w \to  v \) by \( f \)
    and decrease the residual capacity from  \( v \to  w \) by \( f \).
\end{enumerate}
